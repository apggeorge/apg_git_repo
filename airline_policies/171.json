    "voluntary_refund": "Flydubai’s voluntary refund policy is governed by the fare rules associated with the ticket. Some fares may be partially refundable while others are strictly non-refundable. Refunds, when permitted, are generally issued in the form of a Voucher, unless applicable law requires reimbursement to the original form of payment. All refund requests must be submitted within the ticket’s validity period, and any deductions (e.g., service fees, used segments) will apply according to the fare conditions.\n\nTickets purchased through GDS must be refunded via the same GDS, and refunds on tickets with Flydubai-issued waivers must include the remark 'Approved by FZ'. Government-imposed taxes (e.g., YQ/YR) are typically non-refundable. Tickets issued by travel agents must be refunded by the issuing agent.\n\nIn situations involving force majeure (e.g., unexpected security surcharges, major global events, or operational emergencies), Flydubai reserves the right to apply post-ticketing surcharges. If a passenger chooses not to travel due to these added costs, they may cancel their booking and receive a refund in the form of a Voucher. Refunds to the original form of payment are only provided if legally required.",
